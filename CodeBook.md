This CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following.
	1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.


    1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
	


    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
